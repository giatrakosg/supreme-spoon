## Aim
The aim of this project is to implement a film watching application. We want to support finding movies and their corresponding torrents.
We also want to include functionality for searching for movies, taking notes, controlling VLC player and taking notes.

We will use a microservice architecture mainly for educational purposes. The main technology stack will be Go(BE) and React(FE).

| Search | Search titles and retrieve torrent magnets/files |
| Media Player | Control VLC media player |
